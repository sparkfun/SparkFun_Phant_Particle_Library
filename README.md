### Phant is No Longer in Operation

Unfortunately Phant, our data-streaming service, is no longer in service
and has been discontinued. The system has reached capacity and, like a less-adventurous Cassini,
has plunged conclusively into a fiery and permanent retirement. There are several 
other maker-friendly, data-streaming services and/or IoT platforms available 
as alternatives. The three we recommend are Blynk, ThingSpeak, and Cayenne. 
You can read our [blog post on the topic](https://www.sparkfun.com/news/2413)
for an overview and helpful links for each platform.

All secondary SparkFun repositories related to Phant have been [archived](https://github.com/blog/2460-archiving-repositories)
and pulled in as a subtree in the main [Phant GitHub repository](https://github.com/sparkfun/phant/tree/master/archived_PhantRepos).

### SparkFun Phant Particle Library

A Phant library for the Particle Core and Photon.

About
-------------------

This is a firmware library SparkFun's Phant data storage/stream service, implemented on [data.sparkfun.com](https://data.sparkfun.com)

[![Phant logo](http://phant.io/img/phant.svg)](https://data.sparkfun.com)

Repository Contents
-------------------

* **/firmware** - Source files for the library (.cpp, .h).
* **/firmware/examples** - Example sketches for the library (.cpp). Run these from the Particle IDE. 
* **spark.json** - General library properties for the Particle library manager. 

Example Usage
-------------------

#### Create a Phant Stream

Visit [data.sparkfun.com](https://data.sparkfun.com) to create a Phant stream of your own. You'll be given public and private keys, don't lose them!

If you want to set up Phant on a server of your own, visit [phant.io](http://phant.io/).

#### Include & Constructor

Make sure you include "SparkFun-Spark-Phant/SparkFun-Spark-Phant.h":

	// Include the Phant library:
	#include "SparkFun-Spark-Phant/SparkFun-Spark-Phant.h":

Then create a Phant object, which requires a **server**, **public key** and **private key**:

	const char server[] = "data.sparkfun.com"; // Phant destination server
	const char publicKey[] = "DJjNowwjgxFR9ogvr45Q"; // Phant public key
	const char privateKey[] = "P4eKwGGek5tJVz9Ar84n"; // Phant private key
	Phant phant(server, publicKey, privateKey); // Create a Phant object
	
#### Adding Fields/Data

Before posting, update every field in the stream using the `add([field], [value])` function. The `[field]` variable will always be a String (or const char array), `[value]` can be just about any basic data type -- `int`, `byte`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `String`, `const char`, etc.

For example:

	phant.add("myByte", 127);
	phant.add("myInt", -42);
	phant.add("myString", "Hello, world");
	phant.add("myFloat", 3.1415);

#### POSTing

After you've phant.add()'ed, you can call `phant.post()` to create a Phant POST string. `phant.post()` returns a string, which you can send straight to a print function.

Most of the time, you'll want to send your `phant.post()` string straight out of a TCPClient print. For example:

	TCPClient client;
	if (client.connect(server, 80)) // Connect to the server
    {
        client.print(phant.post());
	}

After calling `phant.post()` all of the field/value parameters are erased. You'll need to make all of your phant.add() calls before calling post again.

Recommended Components
-------------------

* [Particle Photon](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13345)
* A [Photon Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/278) or [sensor](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/23) to interface with your Photon and post data to Phant.
